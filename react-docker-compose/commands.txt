1. Create the react-docker-compose project
    npm create vite@latest react-docker-compose
2. Move the folder 
    cd react-docker-compose    
3. This command automatically creates the docker compose file
    docker init
    then make the settings 
4. Update the Dockerfile and the compose.yaml
5. run the docker-compose
    docker compose up [DON'T RUN IT IN DETACHED MODE IT WILL NOT WORK]
    BUT we get permission denied So, we need to close VS code and the run it as administrator.
6. Update the package.json as follows:
    "dev": "vite --host" [for the localhost to work]
